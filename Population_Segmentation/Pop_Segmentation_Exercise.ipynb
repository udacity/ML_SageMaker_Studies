    "# Population Segmentation with SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do **population segmentation**. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **principal component analysis** (PCA) you will reduce the dimensionality of the original census data. Then, you'll use **k-means clustering** to assign each US county to a particular cluster based on where a county lies in component space. How each cluster is arranged in component space can tell you which US counties are most similar and what demographic traits define that similarity; this information is most often used to inform targeted, marketing campaigns that want to appeal to a specific group of people. This cluster information is also useful for learning more about a population by revealing patterns between regions that you otherwise may not have noticed.\n",

    "You'll be using data collected by the [US Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census), which aims to count the US population, recording demographic traits about labor, age, population, and so on, for each county in the US. The bulk of this notebook was taken from an existing SageMaker example notebook and [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/analyze-us-census-data-for-population-segmentation-using-amazon-sagemaker/), and I've broken it down further into demonstrations and exercises for you to complete.\n",

    "* Dimensionality reduction with PCA\n",
    "* Feature engineering and data transformation\n",

    "* Extracting trained model attributes and visualizing k clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks make up a complete, machine learning workflow from data loading and cleaning to model deployment.

To decide how many top components to include, it's helpful to look at how much **data variance** the components capture. For our original, high-dimensional data, 34 features captured 100% of our data variance. If we discard some of these higher dimensions, we will lower the amount of variance we can capture.\n",

The below images are taken from the PhD thesis,  [“Approaches to analyse and interpret biological profile data”](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/696) by Matthias Scholz, (2006, University of Potsdam, Germany).\n",

So, we can instead choose to create two new dimensions, made up of linear combinations of the original, three dimensions. These dimensions are represented by the two axes/lines, centered in the data. \n",
